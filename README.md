# SocialMediaWebApp

Worked with a group to develop and create a social media web app inspired by twitter and reddit with options like creating
a tweet, uploading images, upvoting/downvoting and having live chat and messaging.

Helped frontend development with styling and the layout of the pages. Also developed the backend API that was used,
created the database through MySQL and connected them using PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
